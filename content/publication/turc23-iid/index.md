abstract: We propose a novel framework for industrial identifiers addressing in industrial networks. It includes the Industrial Identifier Resolution Protocol (IIRP), which combines an ARP-like table lookup, Ethernet frames broadcast, and caching mechanisms on switches to support quick and accurate identifier-MAC resolution. Furthermore, we introduce a hardware-based lookup algorithm for switch tables that employs Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) to search the table quickly and efficiently, as well as a mechanism that triggers TCAM and SRAM updates to ensure the accuracy of identifier-MAC mapping.
