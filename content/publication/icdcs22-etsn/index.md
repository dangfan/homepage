abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the most promising network technology for Industry 4.0. A series of IEEE standards on TSN introduce deterministic transmission into standard Ethernet. Under the current paradigm, TSN can only schedule the deterministic transmission of time-triggered critical traffic (TCT), neglecting the other type of traffic in industrial cyber physical systems, i.e., event-triggered critical traffic (ECT). So in this work, we propose a new paradigm for TSN scheduling named E-TSN, which can provide deterministic transmission for both TCT and ECT. The three techniques of E-TSN, i.e., probabilistic stream, prioritized slot sharing, and prudent reservation, enable the deterministic transmission of ECT in TSN, and at the same time, protect TCT from the impacts of ECT. We also develop and make public a TSN evaluation toolkit to fill the gap in TSN study between algorithm design and experimental validation. The experiments show that E-TSN can reduce the latency and jitter of ECT by at least an order of magnitude compared to state-of-theart methods. By enabling reliable and timely delivery of ECT in TSN for the first time, E-TSN can broaden the application scope of TSN in industry.
