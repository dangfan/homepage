abstract: With the increasing popularity of industrial networks, driven by the development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data, there are still security threats when it comes to using wireless communication technologies, including BLE, in these networks. This is primarily due to the heterogeneity and resource limitations of the devices. To address the issues of device cloning and enhance BLE device access authentication, a device authentication mechanism based on physical features can be employed. By leveraging the uniqueness and nonreplicability of physical attributes, such as fingerprints, this mechanism effectively mitigates attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a BLE device authentication scheme called FingerBLE, which relies on the physical fingerprints of devices at the physical-layer. In terms of system design, this article also introduces a fingerprint database authentication mechanism that utilizes the aforementioned fingerprints for node recognition and legitimacy authentication. Experimental results demonstrate that FingerBLE is capable of successfully extracting corresponding device fingerprints and accurately identifying nodes across a wide range of tests.
