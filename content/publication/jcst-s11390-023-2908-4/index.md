abstract: "Clock synchronization is one of the most fundamental and crucial network communication strategies. With the expansion of the Industrial Internet in numerous industrial applications, a new requirement for the precision, security, complexity, and other features of the clock synchronization mechanism has emerged in various industrial situations. This paper presents a study of standardized clock synchronization protocols and techniques for various types of networks, and a discussion of how these protocols and techniques might be classified. Following that is a description of how certain clock synchronization protocols and technologies, such as PROFINET, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), and other well-known industrial networking protocols, can be applied in a number of industrial situations. This study also investigates the possible future development of clock synchronization techniques and technologies."
