abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Mesh is a pivotal multi-hop self-organizing network in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, offering low power consumption, low cost, and robustness. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the communication performance of BLE-Mesh using commercial off-the-shelf devices, focusing on the impact of key mesh parameters such as transmission power, packet interval, and network structure on performance. Through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments, we quantify the impact of these parameters and conduct a detailed study. Our findings provide insights into the actual communication range of BLE-Mesh, the effect of node design on overall network performance, and the configuration for optimal performance. The research contributes to the establishment of a BLE-Mesh network in real-world environments, answering critical questions for practitioners, and offering a reference for future BLE-Mesh deployments. This work furthers our understanding of the characteristics, challenges, and future directions of BLE-Mesh, setting the stage for advancements in IoT applications such as smart offices and homes.
