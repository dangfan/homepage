abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic data transmission strategy for smart home environments that aims to optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE) by adaptively adjusting the data upload frequency based on the predicted trends in sensor data. Using the home wireless sensors monitoring dataset, we implement a deep learning model for accurate time series forecasting. In addition, an anomaly detection mechanism is used to identify critical events, requiring more frequent data uploads when important changes are detected. The QoE is quantified through a weighted average of several influencing factors, including data timeliness, timely upload of critical events, and transmission frequency. Our optimization objective is to maximize QoE while minimizing the number of transmissions, with an emphasis on reducing energy consumption through intelligent scheduling. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively balances data timeliness, transmission efficiency, and energy savings, leading to improved user satisfaction in smart home applications.
