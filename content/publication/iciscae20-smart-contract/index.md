abstract: "As the core of present blockchain applications, smart contracts are designed to help multiple parties reach an agreement. Along with the promotion of smart contract applications, a large number of economic losses caused by attacks on smart contract vulnerabilities have emerged. Since most smart contracts only disclose bytecode, in recent years, there have been numerous researches on the vulnerability detection of smart contract bytecode, mainly for Ethereum smart contracts, achieving considerable results. My survey summarizes the methods and supported vulnerability types of these tools, aimed at Ethereum or EOSIO, over the years. The problems reflected in it shed light on the future work of smart contract bytecode vulnerability detection."
