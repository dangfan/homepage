abstract: Efforts to enhance the user experience (UX) of telepresence edge systems in various application scenarios have been significant. However, existing approaches tend to focus on specific aspects, leaving us with a fragmented understanding of UX quality. We address this gap by examining Video Conference Systems (VCSs) for remote collaboration, using an Information Theory Perspective as a lens. We introduce a novel model to quantify the multimodality information users receive while engaged in mobile office environments, enabling an evaluation of existing VCSs. Our approach transforms the assessment of UX quality into the measurement of a set of information channels. Based on this insight, we identify new prospects and meaningful guidelines for future multimedia telepresence edge systems and try to induce a new prototype design under cost restriction. To demonstrate the validity of our method, we implement the prototype which seamlessly integrates visual, audio, and olfactory dimension information. Extensive experiments and user studies validate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.
