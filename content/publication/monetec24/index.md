abstract: The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) authentication protocol, the latest iteration of the FIDO2 standard, aims to provide a more secure and user-friendly online authentication method. In the era of digital transformation, anonymity has become a critical aspect of digital security. This paper proposes a novel anonymous authentication extension for FIDO based on blind signatures, enabling users to obtain signatures on public keys without revealing their content to the relying party. The proposed scheme is evaluated in detail, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. By addressing a significant gap in current authentication methods and enhancing user privacy, this research contributes to the advancement of secure and anonymous online authentication techniques.
