abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile hardware, smart-phones are now capable of capturing and playing videos in 4K and even 8K resolution, improving immersive and enjoyable viewing experience for users. However, storing these ultra-high-resolution videos poses a significant burden on the local storage of mobile devices. An alternative method is storing video on cloud with the benefits of scalable storage space, cross-device data access, data sharing and backup. Recently, the policy has been integrated into mainstream mobile operation systems. Nevertheless, downloading video from cloud may face high latency under poor network conditions, significantly diminishing the user experience.
