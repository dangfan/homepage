abstract: "Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a privacy-preserving model training paradigm. However, traditional FL protocol heavily relies on data transmission between clients and servers across the wide-area network (WAN), which is tightly constrained and unreliable, therefore causing expensive communication and slow convergence. To this end, we propose a LAN-aware FL (LanFL) protocol, which can efficiently leverage the network capacity of the local-area network (LAN). By frequent model aggregation among the devices within the same LAN, we can significantly reduce the global aggregation across WAN, thus accelerating the training process. However, due to the unique challenges introduced by LAN, it’s not easy to efficiently utilize LAN resources while preserving the original dignity of FL performance. Therefore, LanFL also incorporates several critical techniques: LAN-aware hierarchical aggregation, intraLAN device topology construction, and inter-LAN heterogeneous bandwidth coordination. Extensive real-world experiments are conducted and the experimental results show that LanFL can significantly accelerate FL training up to 6.0×, while preserving the model accuracy."
